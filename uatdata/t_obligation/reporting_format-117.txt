No joint water-quality monitoring system is established within the ICPO. Transboundary monitoring of the Oder river is organised by bilateral commissions of the riparian countries. The 3 countries have agreed on joint transboundary monitoring at a selection of stations, that are part of each of the national networks. The German-Polish Commission has selected 13 stations along the Lusatian Neisse, 9 stations along the Oder mainstream, 12 in the Szczecinski lagoon and 4 in the Pomeranian Bay. The Polish-Czech Commission has agreed on the selection of 10 stations, 9 at different tributaries and 1 at the main stream in Chalupki. One station at the Lusatian Neisse is sampled by the 3 countries.
