The Floods Directive indicates that Member States may make use of the administrative arrangements made under Article 3 of the Water Framework Directive. However, different competent authorities may be appointed by Member States for the Floods Directive.  The Floods Directive also allows Member States to identify different units of management from the river basin districts used for the Water Framework Directive.

Member States shall (Article 3 of the Floods Directive):
(a) appoint competent authorities different from those identified pursuant to Article 3(2) of Directive 2000/60/EC;
(b) identify certain coastal areas or individual river basins and assign them to a unit of management different from those assigned pursuant to Article 3(1) of Directive 2000/60/EC.

In these cases, Member States shall, by 26 May 2010, communicate to the Commission the information referred to in Annex I to Directive 2000/60/EC. 
Any changes in administrative arrangements also need to be communicated within three months of the change coming into effect.
