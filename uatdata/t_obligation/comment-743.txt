For the purposes of reporting projected emissions, “projections with measures” means projections of anthropogenic emissions that encompass the effects, in terms of air pollutant emission reductions, of policies and measures that have been adopted at the time the projection is calculated. “Projections with additional measures” means projections of anthropogenic emissions that encompass the effects in terms of air pollutant emission reductions of policies and measures which have been adopted, as well as policies and measures which are planned at the time the projection is calculated.
