EC (2000) Guidance Document for EPER implementation. According to Article 3 of the Commission Decision of 17 July 2000 (2000/479/EC) on the implementation of an European Pollutant Emission Register (EPER) according to Article 15 of Council Directive 96/61/EC concerning Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC). European Commission, DG Environment, November 2000.

E-PRTR (European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register) succeed the EPER. It is based on Regulation (EC) No 166/2006 and is intended to fully implement the obligations of the UN-ECE PRTR Protocol, which was signed in May 2003 by 36 countries and the European Community. The obligations under the E-PRTR Regulation extend beyond the scope of EPER mainly in terms of more facilities included, more substances to report, additional coverage of releases to land, off-site transfers of waste and releases from diffuse sources, public participation and annual instead of triennial reporting. The first reporting year under the E-PRTR will be the year 2007 and respective information will have to be reported by Member States in June 2009. The Commission will publish the data in autumn 2009.
