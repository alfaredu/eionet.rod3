At its eleventh session, the Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD) decided that its programme of work would be organised on the basis of seven two-year cycles, with each cycle focusing on selected thematic clusters of issues. The annual reports are prepared on the status of each Party's implementation of Agenda 21 in relation to the specific themes under discussion at that year's CSD meeting. Guidelines are developed by the CSD to assist countries in the preparation of these national annual reports.
With its fourteenth session (May 2006), the Commission on Sustainable Development (CSD) begins the second cycle of its multi-year programme of work, focusing on four main thematic issues: atmosphere, climate change, energy and industry. As in each cycle, the thematic clusters of issues will be addressed in an integrated manner, taking into account economic, social and environmental dimensions of sustainable development. 

National reports should be submitted in one of the UN's six official languages. (National reports are available on the CSD website but are only available in English, French or Spanish, and no translations are available.) The reports should be submitted in an electronic format (Microsoft Word), by e-mail or by mailing the diskette.
