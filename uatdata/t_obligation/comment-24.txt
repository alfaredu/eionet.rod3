The Conventions are collaborating with Euro Chlor for the initial annual inventory (Part I) that is sent from them to the OSPAR secretariat. The Contracting Parties are then to verify the submitted information from Euro Chlor. Confirmed data are to be sent to the OSPAR secretariat 2 months in advance of the next PDS meeting together with information on future phasing out of national mercury-based chlor alkali production capacities. Discharges to the Baltic Sea, The Black Sea, The Mediterranean Sea, as well as to the Northeast Atlantic Ocean have to be reported.
