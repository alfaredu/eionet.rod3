Key guidelines include the following:

a)to reduce pollution loads from the leather industry Best Available Technologies as per examples listed in Appendix 1, should be selectively applied. It is essential to reduce the volume of waste water discharges through, i.a., a specific water consumption reduction to a maximum rate of 50 m3/t input hide;

b)waste water discharges into either water bodies or municipal sewerage systems should be treated using optional waste water treatment processes, examples of which are listed in Appendix 2;
c)the limit values for waste water discharges from the leather industry into water bodies or municipal sewerage systems should not exceed the following values:

Crtot -0.075 kg/t input hide as annual mean and 1.5 mg/l Cr as 24 h-value or shorter sampling period

CODCr -20 kg/t input hide as annual mean for discharges to water bodies and for discharges into sewerage systems which are not connected to municipal treatment plants

tot-N -8 kg /t input hide as annual mean for discharges to water bodies and for discharges into sewerage systems which are not connected to municipal treatment plants

Internationally accepted standardized sampling, analysing and quality assurance methods (e.g. CEN-standards, ISO-standards and OECD-Guidelines) should be used whenever available;
d)the tanning odour influence should be taken into account in siting of a new production unit as well as in a sludge dumping location,
