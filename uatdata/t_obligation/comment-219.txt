The RISs and their accompanying maps are held by the Ramsar Bureau.  The information provided by Contracting Parties in the RIS is used as the basis for entering data and information into the Ramsar Sites Database, with management on behalf of the Ramsar Convention by Wetlands International under contract from the Ramsar Bureau.  The database is managed so as to provide an information service on Ramsar sites, including undertaking analysis and reporting to meetings of the Conference of the Parties on progress in implementing the Strategic Framework and Vision for the List of Wetlands of International Importance (Resolution VII.11) and other Resolutions of the Conference of the Parties.

The information provided by Parties in the RIS, including any supplementary information provided, and held in the Ramsar Sites Database is also used by Wetlands International to compile the Ramsar Sites Directory for each meeting of the Conference of the Parties.  The Directory provides a publicly-accessible standardised summary of the features and conservation status of each designated Ramsar site, and is also available on the Wetlands International website (www.wetlands.org).

EEA maintains a biodiversity information system at
