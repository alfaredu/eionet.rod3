The reporting format was agreed by the Standing Committee at its 23rd meeting (Bonn, December 2001) for voluntary use by Parties, on a trial basis, for reports submitted to the Seventh Meeting of the Conference of the Parties (CoP7) (Bonn, 2002).  CoP7 recommended that the format be presented to the 26th meeting of the Standing Committee for final approval and formal adoption, and this took place in July 2003.

A partly pre-filled report format is sent (electronically) to each Party by the CMS Secretariat.  Parties are requested to check the information included and amend as appropriate, and to complete those sections where no information has been provided.  Parties are encouraged to submit their reports electronically.  (The possibility of submitting of reports on-line is in development.)

The format is not available on-line.  However, completed reports are available on the CMS website (www.unep-wcmc.org/cms).  In addition, a sample report is available on the UNEP World Conservation Monitoring Centre website (www.unep-wcmc.org).
