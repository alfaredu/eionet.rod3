At its twentieth session in 1996, the World Heritage Committee adopted a format and explanatory notes for the nomination of cultural and natural properties for inscription on the World Heritage List. 

State Parties are encouraged to provide information and documentation on all items listed in the format, including maps and/or plans showing boundary of area proposed for inscription and any buffer zone, copies of property management plans and extracts of other plans relevant to the property, and photographs, slides and, where available, film/video. (The World Heritage Committee will retain all supporting documentation submitted with the nomination.)

Nominations should be completed on A4 paper (210mm x 297mm) with maps and plans a maximum of A3 (297mm x 420 mm). They should be submitted in English or French and three copies should be sent, signed by the UNESCO National Commission and/or Permanent Delegation of the State Party to UNESCO.  Parties are also encouraged to submit the full text of the nomination on diskette.

The World Heritage Committee has decided not to consider cultural properties which are no included in the tentative list of cultural properties.
