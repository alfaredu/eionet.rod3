The Parties have not yet agreed on a standard format or guidelines for the preparation and submission of biennial reports.  However, some guidance for their preparation has been suggested by TRAFFIC Europe (at the request of the European Commission to undertake such work) for use by the Member States of the European Union.  This consists primarily of a set of report components linked to a number of specific provisions in EU legislation.  In addition, the Secretariat has developed a "List of priority items for the preparation of beinnial reports" (CoP12 Doc. 22.2, Annex 2).

The Secretariat maintains a table of biennial report submissions, but this is not available on-line.
