The main outputs planned from FRA 2005 are: 1) country reports, summarising the information provided by each country; 2) special reports on key issues, such as "mountain forests", "forests and water", "biological diversity" and "planted forests", drawing largely from country information and other sources; 3) a main report that summarises all findings and analyses trends since the previous assessment in 2000; and 4) contributions to SOFO 2005.

The objective of country-level reporting is: 1) to produce by 2005 a comprehensive update and refinement of FRA 2000, structured around common themes (criteria) for sustainable forest management, building on original national-level information, focussing on trend information for a limited set of global variables, and including additional country-specific information relevant to each theme; 2) to involve National Correspondents and experts to the extent possible in the collection, analyses and validation of information to secure national ownership of results; 3) to report all information transparently and with complete documentation of information sources and analyses applied on source data on the FAO forestry website.

The information provided is relevant for many international processes and agencies, including: 1) Convention on Sustainable Development; 2) Convention on Biological Diversity; 3) Convention to Combat Desertification; 4) Food and Agriculture Organisation; 5) International Tropical Timber Organisation; 6) International Union for the Conservation of Nature; 7) the Ministerial Conference on the Protection of Forests in Europe; 8) Eurostat; 9) Millenium Ecosystem Assessment; 10) United Nations Millennium Development Goals; 11) United Nations Economic Commission for Europe; 12) United Nations Environment Programme; 13) Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change; and 14) United Nations Forum on Forests.
