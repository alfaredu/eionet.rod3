To achieve greater regionalisation and decentralisation of World Heritage Work, the reports will be examined by region and the World Heritage Centre will synthesise the national reports-by-region (as a Regional State of the World Heritage Report).  The World Heritage Committee decides for which regions the periodic reports should be presented to its forthcoming sessions.  The reports are being examined by the World Heritage Committee as follows: 1)Arab States: examination of properties inscribed up to and including 1992 took place in 2000; 2) Africa: examination of properties inscribed up to and including 1993 took place in  2001; 3) Asia and Pacific: examination of properties inscribed up to and including 1994 took place in 2002; 4) Latin America and the Caribbean: examination of properties inscribed up to and including 1995 took place in 2003; and, 5) Europe and North America: examination of properties inscribed up to and including 1996/7 will take place in 2004 and 2005. 
The World Heritage Committee includes its findings in its report to the General Conference of UNESCO.

The World Heritage Centre's website has a page for each of the regions.  Where periodic reports have been submitted and examined, the regional page provides information from the reports and feedback. For regions that have yet to report (i.e. Europe and North America), the regional page provides information on the reporting process and timetable (see 'Periodic Reporting Europe and North America', whc.unesco.org/nwhc/pages/doc/main.htm).

EEA maintains a biodiversity information system at

and sites in the context of European legislation.
