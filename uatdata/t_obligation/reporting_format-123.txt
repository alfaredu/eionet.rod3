An international programme for routine transboundary monitoring with regular reporting to the coordinating body is in place (Trans National Monitoring Network). The objectives of the TNMN are to support reliable and consistent trend analysis of concentration loads for priority pollutants, support the assessment of water quality and use, and assist in the identification of major pollution sources. The specific requirements of the TNMN are to include sediment biomonitoring and quality control, be compatible with other major international river basins in Europe, and to comply with standards used in the western part of Europe. Further, the TNMN has been adapted to the requirements of the EU Water Framework Directive (Article 8) in the end of 2008. Therefore, all types of monitoring and relevant parameters are covered by the monitoring network including all WFD Biological Quality Elements.
A Danube Pollution Reduction Programme was conducted during 1997 to 1999.
The Danube Regional Project (DRP) planned for 2001-2006 is actually one of three components of the Global Environment Facility (GEF) Strategic Partnership for Nutrient Reduction in the Danube / Black Sea Basin. One of the goals is the reinforcement of monitoring, evaluation and information systems to control transboundary pollution, and to reduce nutrients and harmful substances.
