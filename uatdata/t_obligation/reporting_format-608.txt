The reporting framework and the reporting content and format, via a set of ‘reporting sheets’, was developed through an informal process starting in May 2011 in the Working Group on Data, Information and Knowledge Exchange (WG DIKE), under the guidance of the Marine Directors. A ‘reporting package’ was endorsed by the Marine Directors in June 2012, comprising the following: a.) The reporting framework concept paper: ‘Approach to reporting for the MSFD’; b.) A set of reporting sheets, addressing geographic aspects, regional cooperation and Articles 8, 9, and 10; c.)As associated guidance document: ‘Guidance for 2012 reporting under the MSFD’.
