Parties have exchanged information by Information Paper from time-to-time.  However, this generally does not occur now unless a Party has changed its procedures, another Party specifically asks for the information, or it arises in some other context (e.g. Australia collated a summary of the EIA processes of Parties in relation to tourist activities in IP40 presented to ATCM XXVI).  The information may be provided as part of the Annual Report, in accordance with the format provided in Resolution 6(2001) of ATCM XXIV.
