The Implementation Committee was established by the Executive Body in 1997 to review compliance by Parties with their obligations under the protocols to the Convention.

The Committee's work focuses on three main areas:

- it reviews periodically compliance with Parties' reporting obligations

- considers any submission or referral of possible non-compliance by an individual Party with any of its obligations under a given protocol

- carries out in-depth reviews of specified obligations in an individual protocol at the request of the Executive Body
