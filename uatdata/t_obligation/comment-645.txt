There is no specific legal base for this questionnaire â€“ it is voluntary reporting (gentlemen's agreement), but there is an indirect obligation as EU countries have approved in Parliament and Council the 5y Statistical Programme and the annual work programmes. In addition, EFTA countries are as well members of the ESS (European Statistical System) and have approved the programmes in the respective governing body SPC (now called ESS Committee). EU candidate countries have to demonstrate their statistical capabilities in the course of their preparation for accession.

The data, as far as validated by Eurostat, are publicly accessible on Eurostat's Database (available at http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/portal/page/portal/statistics/search_database), then go to theme "Environment and energy". Eurostat also presents and explains selected water statistics on its Wikistyle Website "Statistics Explained" at http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/Water_statistics        
Parts of the data are used for publications (Statistical Yearbook, Key Figures on Europe).
