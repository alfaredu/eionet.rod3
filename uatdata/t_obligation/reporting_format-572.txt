From technical point of view CLC2012 is the same as CLC2006. Therefore it is not the purpose of this document to provide a complete guide to CLC2012. The document is complementary to CLC2006 Technical Guidelines published at: http://www.eea.europa.eu/publications/technical_report_2007_17  

In addition to the Addendum, there are other important documents to be used (Table 2).
