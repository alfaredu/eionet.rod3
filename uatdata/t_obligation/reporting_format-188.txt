A draft format has been prepared by the Intergovernmental Committee for the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety (in Annex to document UNEP/CBD/ICCP/2/4).  Governments have been invited to provide written comments on the draft format.  In addition, the format will be amended to take account of such new elements that refine and clarify the obligations on Parties to the Protocol as may be agreed at the first meeting of the Conference of the Parties.  Third meeting of the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to the Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety will be held 13-17 March in Brazil. 

Parties are requested to submit reports in both hard copy and electronic format.  An electronic version of each report submitted will be sent to all national focal points and this will also be available on the CBD website.
