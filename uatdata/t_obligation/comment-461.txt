This Decision shall be applied to any regulatory action, such as the granting of permits or approvals by authorities, concerning the use of, or the discharge of, chemicals from offshore sources. In the territory of those Contracting Parties where the use and discharge of offshore chemicals are regulated by frame permits based on internal (in-company) environmental control and where specific elements of the procedures required by the programmes and measures stipulated below are carried out by the companies themselves, the authorities shall be responsible for effective enforcement and control by a system of regular auditing, inspection or monitoring.
