A template file has been distributed to the National Correspondents in order to facilitate the compilation of the country report. The Country Report Template contains the basic structure of the country report, following a standardized format for publication as a FRA working paper. The template provides one chapter for each table and, under each table, a number of sub-headings.
Several pilot working papers have been developed to serve as examples and are available on the Forest Resources Assessment Programme's website (www.fao.org/forestry/foris/webview/forestry2/index.jsp?siteId=101&langId=1).
The suggested format was discussed and finalised during November 2003.
