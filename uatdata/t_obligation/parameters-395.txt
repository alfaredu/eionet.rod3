Atmospheric emissions from waste incineration should not exceed the following levels at 11% O2 (ndg):


Parameter A (mg/m³) 
Dust 10 
CO 50 
HCI 10 
HF 1 
SO2 50 
NOx (as NO2) 200 
For existing plants with a nominal capacity exceeding 6 tonnes per hour or new incineration plant 
NOx (as NO2) 400 
For existing plants with a nominal capacity of 6 tonnes per hour or less 
Cd + TI 0,05 
Hg 0,05 
Sb+As+Pb+Cr+Co+Cu+Mn+Ni+V 0,5 
Dioxins and furans 0,1 ng TEQ/ m3 
 


Measurements should be based on internationally accepted methods. Emission levels in the table are daily average values for all parameters except metals and dioxins/furans which are based on ”spot-sample-values” in accordance with requirements specified in the EU Directive 2000/76/EC on incineration of waste.

 



Discharges of waste water from cleaning of exhaust gases should not exceed the following levels (24 h samples) in column A:


Parameter A (mg/l) B Sampling 
Total suspended solids 30 Based on spot daily or flow proportional sample 
Hg 0,03 Monthly measurement of a flow proportional representative sample of the discharge over a period of 24 hours with one measurement per year exceeding the values given, or no more than 5 % where more than 20 samples are assessed per year 
Cd 0,05 
TI 0,05 
As 0,15 
Pb 0,2 
Cr 0,5 
Cu 0,5 
Ni 0,5 
Zn 1,5 
Dioxins and furans 0,3 ng/l At least every 6 months measurements of a flow proportional representative sample of the discharge over a period of 24 hours. However, one measurement at least every 3 months should be carried out fore the first 12 months of operation. 
 


pH-level for water should not be below 7,0.

Measurements should be based on internationally accepted methods and in accordance with requirements specified in the EU Directive 2000/76/EC on incineration of waste.
