A formal request is sent to NFPs and NRCs every year with reference to templates to use and guidelines. The guidelines are being updated every year. Since 2012 the request has also been sent to Ecostat network and national contact points who provided biological test data in 2009 - 2012 (available at http://forum.eionet.europa.eu/nrc-eionet-freshwater/library/wise-soe-reporting-2013/biological-data-reporting). Letter on WISE SoE data request 2013 is available at http://icm.eionet.europa.eu/announcements/ann1374509837          

The general content of reporting as agreed by Water Directors is described in the guidance document "Reporting required for assessing the state of, and trends in, the water environment at the European level" (February 2009), which includes reporting sheets for several EEA SoE data flows, available at http://forum.eionet.europa.eu/nrc-eionet-freshwater/library/reporting_eionetwfd/guidance_2009pdf  
In addition, updated and new SoE reporting sheets for biology in rivers and lakes (July 2010) are also available on the NRC EIONET Freshwater interest group library (subfolder SOE- reporting guidance Eionet/WFD CIS) at http://forum.eionet.europa.eu/nrc-eionet-freshwater/library/reporting_eionetwfd
