The main objectives of litterfall sampling and analysis are to quantify litterfall production chemical composition over time in order to, assess the variation in litterfall amount and hence its role in nutrient cycling, across an environmental gradient of climate (moisture and temperature) and soil conditions, understand the relationship of climate and species on litterfall rates, understand the turnover of the biomass, the amount of litter produced, its composition and chemical content and improve our knowledge on the link between the C and the nutrient budgets/cycles.
