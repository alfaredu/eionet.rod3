Article 6 of the Floods Directive requires Member States to prepare flood hazard and flood risk maps (at the river basin level and at the most appropriate scale) for the areas of potential significant flood risk identified under Article 5 or 13.1(a), or for the areas for which Member States decided to prepare flood maps according to Article 13.1(b). 
Flood hazard maps must show the geographical area which could be flooded under different scenarios (Article 6.3), whereas flood risk maps must show the potential adverse consequences of these flood scenarios (Article 6.5).
