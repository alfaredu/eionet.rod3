For all combustion plants covered by Chapter III of Directive 2010/75/EU, Member States shall, from 1 January 2016, establish an annual inventory of the sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and dust emissions and energy input.

Taking into account the aggregation rules set out in Article 29, the competent authority shall obtain the following data for each combustion plant:

(a) the total rated thermal input (MW) of the combustion plant;

(b) the type of combustion plant: boiler, gas turbine, gas engine, diesel engine, other (specifying the type);

(c) the date of the start of operation of the combustion plant;

(d) the total annual emissions (tonnes per year) of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxides and dust (as total suspended particles);

(e) the number of operating hours of the combustion plant;

(f) the total annual amount of energy input, related to the net calorific value (TJ per year), broken down in terms of the following categories of fuel: coal, lignite, biomass, peat, other solid fuels (specifying the type), liquid fuels, natural gas, other gases (specifying the type).
