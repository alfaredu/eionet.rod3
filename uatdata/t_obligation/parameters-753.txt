The initial national air pollution control programmes referred to in Articles 6 and 10 shall at least cover the following content:
(a) the national air quality and pollution policy framework in which context the programme has been developed, including: (i) the policy priorities and their relationship to priorities set in other relevant policy areas, including climate change and, when appropriate, agriculture, industry and transport; (ii) the responsibilities attributed to national, regional and local authorities; (iii) the progress made by current policies and measures in reducing emissions and improving air quality, and the degree of compliance with national and Union obligations; (iv) the projected further evolution assuming no change to already adopted policies and measures;

(b) the policy options considered to comply with the emission reduction commitments for the period between 2020 and 2029 and for 2030 onwards and the intermediate emission levels determined for 2025 and to contribute to further improve the air quality, and their analysis, including the method of analysis; where available, the individual or combined impacts of the policies and measures on emission reductions, air quality and the environment and the associated uncertainties;

(c) the measures and policies selected for adoption, including a timetable for their adoption, implementation and review and the competent authorities responsible;

(d) where relevant, an explanation of the reasons why the indicative emission levels for 2025 cannot be met without measures entailing disproportionate costs;

(e) where relevant, an account of the use of the flexibilities set out in Article 5 and any environmental consequences arising from such use;

(f) an assessment of how selected policies and measures ensure coherence with plans and programmes set up in other relevant policy areas. 2. The national air pollution control programme updates referred to in Articles 6 and 10 shall at least include: (a) an assessment of the progress made with implementation of the programme, the reduction of emissions and the reduction of concentrations; (b) any significant changes in the policy context, assessments, the programme or the implementation timetable thereof.
