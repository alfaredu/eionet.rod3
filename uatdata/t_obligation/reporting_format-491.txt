Contracting Parties should report on any OSPAR marine protected areas that they have selected or deselected, on any management plans that they have adopted or substantially amended and on any other issues that the OSPAR Commission has identified for reporting in that year.
As a guide for reporting, Contracting Parties should use the proforma for compiling the characteristics of a potential marine protected area in Appendix 4 of the Guidelines for the Identification and Selection of Marine Protected Areas in the OSPAR Maritime Area (reference number: 2003-17).
