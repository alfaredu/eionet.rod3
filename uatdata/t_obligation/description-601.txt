Article 4 of the Floods Directive requires Member States to undertake a Preliminary Flood Risk Assessment (PFRA) for each river basin district, unit of management or the portion of an international river basin district or unit of management lying within their territory. The identification of Areas of Potential Significant Flood Risk (APSFR, Article 5) will be based on available or readily derivable information, including the requirements specified in Article 4 (PFRA) in the Directive. 
In the 1st implementation cycle Member States may apply Article 13.1 (transitional arrangements) and either report on a PFRA carried out before 22 December 2010 (Article 13.1(a)) or proceed directly to mapping and establishment of flood risk management plans (Article 13.1(b)). If Article 13.1(a) is applied, the result will include the identification of APSFR (Article 5), if Article 13.1(b) is applied, APSFR will not be identified; instead maps at the appropriate scale according to Article 6 (see Flood Hazard Maps and Flood Risk Maps) will be prepared.
