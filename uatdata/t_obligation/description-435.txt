Governments of the Contracting Parties carry out for main tanker transport routes, bound to the main ports/terminals and/or off-shore loading places in their territory or in waters under their jurisdiction, an evaluation on the need for escort towing services for laden oil and chemical tankers on voyages to and from oil and chemical ports, terminals and off-shore loading places where a failure of propulsion or steering of a tanker is likely to cause a severe pollution incident due to narrow straits, shallow depths, archipelago areas and/or ice conditions during winter period.
