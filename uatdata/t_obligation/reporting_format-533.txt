See Annex I of the Commission Decision 92/446/EEC amended by Decision 95/337/EC, the exact design of the table will be made at a later stage together with a precise explanation of each question.

Given that the Water Framework Directive covers all impacts, including dangerous substances, the Commission expects that reports under the Water Framework Directive within the already agreed format will cover all relevant information on these as well. Consequently, the questionnaire under the Decision need not be used any more. See for the guidelines of reporting obligations under the Water Framework Directive.
