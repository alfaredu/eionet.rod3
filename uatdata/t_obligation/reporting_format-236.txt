The Eleventh General Assembly of States Parties to the World Heritage Convention and the twenty-ninth General Conference of UNESCO examined the matter of periodic reporting.  The World Heritage Committee, at its twenty-second session in December 1998, took decisions on the periodicity of the periodic reporting, the handling and examination of the periodic reports and the format for these periodic reports.  Explanatory Notes are provided to give guidance in the preparation of reports, and are available online (whc.unesco.org/reporting/mon-intr.htm).

Periodic reports should be completed on A4 paper (210mm x 297mm) with maps and plans a maximum of A3 paper (297mm x 420mm).  State Parties are also encouraged to submit the full text of the periodic reports in electronic form.

State Parties may request expert advice from the Secretariat or the Advisory Bodies (ICOMOS, ICCROM and IUCN).  The Secretariat may also commission expert advice with the agreement of the States Parties.
