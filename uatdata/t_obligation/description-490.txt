This Recommendation aims to promote the reporting of encounters with dumped convention and chemical munitions by fishermen and other users of the sea and and its coastline, and to establish a record of such encounters. This is to facilitate discussion on the management options for dumping sites, identification of the extent of areas around known dumping sites and of previously unknown, or unrecorded, dumping sites, and designation on navigational charts of areas where a high risk exists of encounters on the seabed with dumped conventional and chemical munitions.
