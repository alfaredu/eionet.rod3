Delivery process or content of this obligation overlaps with another reporting obligations (http://rod.eionet.europa.eu/obligations/184 , http://rod.eionet.europa.eu/obligations/632 and http://rod.eionet.europa.eu/obligations/613) 
Streamlining between the WISE-SoE reporting and the Eurostat/OECD Joint Questionnaire on Inland Waters (JQ IWA) has been incorporated to the possible degree. If countries report data under water quantity and emissions to water in 2013, this will be used to pre-fill the 2014 Eurostat/OECD Joint Questionnaire and no Eurostat reporting has to be done by the country. In addition, the questionnaire will be pre-filled with some parameters introduced under UWWT Directive - Article 15 - implementation for 2013 reporting.
