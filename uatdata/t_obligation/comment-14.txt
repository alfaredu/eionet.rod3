The WISE-6 is managed through the Eionet NRC coastal, marine, maritime network. However, it overlaps with similar dataflows established under Helcom and OSPAR. To avoid double reporting, the EEA has adopted a practice where data reported under the Regional Sea Conventions (RSCs) mechanisms are incorporated into the WISE-6 by ICES. This is possible due to the open access data policy of these conventions.
