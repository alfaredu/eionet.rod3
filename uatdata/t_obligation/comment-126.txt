There are reporting obligations here but they are not environmental obligations, mostly technical and not requiring monitoring or assessment data on state of the environment or pressures on the environment, so they have not been included here. They may need to be considered later if information is needed for Reponses to environmental problems in the DPSIR scheme. They are not legal except for those incorporated into international laws. 
The most important convention regulating and preventing marine pollution by ships is the IMO International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, 1973, as modified by the Protocol of 1978 relating thereto (MARPOL 73/78). It covers accidental and operational oil pollution as well as pollution by chemicals, goods in packaged form, sewage, garbage and air pollution. IMO also has Secretariat responsibilities for the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter (LDC), 1972, generally known as the London Convention.
