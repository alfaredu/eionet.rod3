“Large point sources” (LPS) are defined as facilities whose combined emissions, within the limited identifiable area of the site premises, exceed the pollutant emission thresholds identified in table 1 below. These thresholds have been extracted from the full list of pollutants in Regulation (EC) No. 166/2006 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 18 January 2006 concerning the establishment of a European Pollutant Release and Transfer Register and amending Council Directives 91/689/EEC and 96/61/EC (E-PRTR Regulation) and its annex II.
