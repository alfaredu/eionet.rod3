Contracting Parties should compile the national implementation reports and send them to the Lead Country (Denmark), with a copy to the Secretariat.  Three maps are requested as part of this report: 1) a map indicating the name or number of each part of the coastline which has been exposed to new or continued coastal defence measures, and the type of measures implemented in each case; 2) a map indicating the name or number of each part of the coast that has been exposed to land reclamation and the type of measures implemented; and 3) a map illustrating old land reclamations that have been exposed to restoration.
