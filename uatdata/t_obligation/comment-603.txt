Development of river basin management plans under Directive 2000/60/EC and of flood risk management plans under this Directive are elements of integrated river basin management. The two processes should therefore use the mutual potential for common synergies and benefits, having regard to the environmental objectives of Directive 2000/60/EC, ensuring efficiency and wise use of resources while recognising that the competent authorities and management units might be different under this Directive and Directive 2000/60/EC. 
The deadline for the first Flood risk management plan corresponds to the deadline of the first review of the WFD River Basin Management Plan http://rod.eionet.europa.eu/obligations/521
