Increased nutrient retention in wetland and freshwater systems should be considered through, e.g.:
(i) restoration of shallow lakes and wetlands;
(ii)large-scale restoration of natural water regimes in drained fens and bogs;
(iii) encouragement of low intensity farming practices on fens and bogs used for agricultural purposes (i.e. preservation or re-establishment of natural or high water regimes, renunciation of fertilization and ploughing);
(iv) allowing natural and re-establishing of the meandering of watercourses, inter alia, taking into account the infrastructure, by means of a combination of green fallowing and the restoration of watercourses.

 

(v)     introduction of environmentally sound practices for maintenance of watercourses;
(vi)     programmes should be developed and action taken to implement the above mentioned measures and to report on the effect of these measures or any other measures taken to reduce nutrient discharges.
