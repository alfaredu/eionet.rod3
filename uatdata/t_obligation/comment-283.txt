The Emerald Network is a network of Areas of Special Conservation Interest (ASCIs), which is to be established in the territory of the Contracting Parties and Observer States to the Bern Convention, including Central and Eastern European countries and the EU Member States.  For EU Member States, Emerald Network sites are those of Natura 2000.  Recommendation No. 16 (1989) defines ASCIs as those designated by states where that area fits one or several of the following conditions: 1) it contributes substantially to the survival of threatened species, endemic species, or any species listed in Appendices I and II of the Convention; 2) it suppose significant numbers of species in an area of high species diversity or supports important populations of one or more species; 3) it contains an important and/or representative sample of endangered habitat types; 4) it contains an outstanding example of a particular habitat type or a mosaic of different habitat types; 5) it represents an important area for one or more migratory species; or 6) it otherwise contributes significantly to the achievement of the objectives of the Convention.  The Emerald Network finds its legal basis in the Bern Convention, in particular Articles 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 9.  Several resolutions and recommendations of the Standing Committee to the Bern Convention give more precise indications on the role and mechanisms for the Emerald Network, including Recommendations Nos. 14, 15 and 16 (1989), Recommendation No. 25 (1991), Resolution No. 3 (1996), Resolution No. 4 (1996), Resolution No. 6 (1998) and Resolution No. 5 (1998).
