The Biodiversity Action Plan was issued by the European Commission in 2006 to accelerate progress to meet the 2010 target. It addresses the challenge of integrating biodiversity concerns into other policy sectors in a unified way. It specifies a comprehensive plan of priority actions and outlines the responsibility of community institutions and Member States in relation to each. It also contains indicators to monitor progress and a timetable for evaluations. The EU has undertaken to provide regular reporting on progress in delivery of the Biodiversity Action Plan.
