This reporting obligation overlaps with requirements of EC Habitats and Birds Directives.

An application for approval of a new BSPA can be sent at any time to the HELCOM Secretariat.

A proposal for a new BSPA should include:

-   a completed pro-forma (see link)
-   a map with the same precision and quality as maps officially published, preferably at a scale of 1:20.000 to 1:100.000, should include at least:
-   4 marked geographical coordinates (lat./long.),
-   major roads and settlements (coastal area),
-   the coastline (coastal areas) and  isobaths,
-   borderline of proposed BSPA 

These guidelines are oriented on ecological criteria of several international conservation acts. Socio-economic and cultural criteria are not considered, because a BSPA should primarily reflect the natural environment of the Baltic Sea Area.
