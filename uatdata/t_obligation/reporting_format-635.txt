This document’s purpose is to provide countries with guidance on implementing Part C of the SOER 2010.
The Part C project started in March 2009 and is being developed through a phased, iterative learning process as the project progresses. This guidance document should be regarded as a living document which will be developed further as appropriate. It will be revisited at the end of each phase as the process becomes more mature and possibilities become clearer.
We foresee four phases, so that we can effectively manage the available resources of the Eionet and EEA and facilitate space for learning:
• Phase 1 - March-June 2009
• Phase 2 - June-September 2009
• Phase 3 - September 2009-February 2010
• Phase 4 - February 2010-June 2010.
