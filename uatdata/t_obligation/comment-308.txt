This reporting obligation was terminated because it is covered by 'Notification of authorisation of a special permit'

Proposed permits are reviewed and commented on by the Scientific Committee at the Annual Meetings when possible.  When permits would be granted prior to the next Annual Meeting, the Secretary sends the proposed permits to members of the Scientific Committee by mail for their comment and review.  In this case, preliminary results of any research resulting from the permits should be made available at the next Annual Meeting of the Scientific Committee.
