Recommendation 4.7 of the Conference of the Parties established that the data sheet developed for the description of Ramsar sites be used by Contracting Parties, and listed the information categories covered by the data sheet.  Resolution V.3 reaffirmed that a completed RIS and site map should be provided upon designation of a Wetland of International Importance for the List of Wetlands of International Importance (Ramsar List). This was reiterated in Resolutions VI.13, VI.16 and VII.12.  

An original format for the RIS was provided in Recommendation 4.7.  Resolutions V.3, VI.13 and VI.16 provide guidance when sheets are to be submitted.  Resolution VIII.10 requests all Parties to use the revised format of the RIS as adopted in Resolution VIII.13 in their designation of new sites, extensions to existing sites and updates of existing sites.  Parties are urged to submit an electronic (MS Word) copy of the RIS and, where possible, digital copies of maps.

Explanatory Notes and Guidelines for Completing the Information Sheet on Ramsar Wetlands are attached to the format.  The total length of a completed RIS should not normally exceed 12 pages.  The most up-to-date available and suitable map of the wetland should be appended to the RIS (in hardcopy and, if possible, also in digital format).  Additional information on each site, such as taxonomic lists of species' status, management plans, copies of published papers or photocopied reports on the site, should be appended to the RIS and are treated as part of the official record of the site.  Photographs (prints, transparencies or electronic images) of the wetland are also welcomed.
