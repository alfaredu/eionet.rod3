This Directive lays down rules to control emissions of sulphur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx) and dust into the air from medium combustion plants, and thereby reduce emissions to air and the potential risks to human health and the environment from such emissions. This Directive also lays down rules to monitor emissions of carbon monoxide (CO).
