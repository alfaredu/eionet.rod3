The original emphasis of the Ramsar Convention was on the conservation and wise use of wetlands primarily to provide habitat for waterbirds.  Over the years, however, the Convention has broadened its scope to cover all aspects of wetland conservation and wise use, recognising the fundamental ecological functions of wetlands and their economic, cultural, scientific and recreational value.  It provides a framework for international co-operation and, by joining the Convention, Contracting Parties make a commitment to: 1) designate at least one site that meets the Ramsar criteria for inclusion in the List of Wetlands of International Importance; 2) protect the ecological character of listed sites; 3) include wetland conservation within their national land-use planning; 4) establish nature reserves on wetlands and promote wetland training; and 5) consult with other Contracting Parties about the implementation of the Convention.
