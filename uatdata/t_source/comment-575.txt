The Caribbean Environment Programme (CEP) is a sub-programme of UNEP's Regional Seas Programme (www.unep.ch/seas/). The CEP's mission is to promote regional co-operation for the protection and the development of the marine environment, and is governed by the Caribbean nations and territories under a programmatic framework, the Caribbean Action Plan. The Plan outlines programmes of assistance, institutional strengthening, and technical co-operation, and led to the adoption of the Cartagena Convention. The activities of the CEP focus mainly on implementation of the protocols, on information management and exchange, and on environmental education and training.
