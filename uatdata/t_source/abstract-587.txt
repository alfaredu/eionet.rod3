The biocidal products directive aims to harmonise the European market for biocidal products and their active substances. Active substances have to be assessed and the decision on their inclusion into Annex I of the Directive shall be taken at Community level. Member States shall authorise the biocidal products in accordance with the rules and procedures set in the Directive. A biocidal product authorised in one Member State shall also be authorised upon application in other Member States unless there are specific grounds to derogate from this principle of mutual recognition.
