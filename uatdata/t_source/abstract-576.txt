The Madrid Protocol includes detailed provisions for environmental co-operation in Antarctica, and it draws on and improves the environmental protection measures previously agreed by the Treaty Parties, and places them in a legally binding regime. Through the Protocol, the Parties commit themselves to a comprehensive protection of the Antarctic environment and dependent and associated ecosystems, emphasising the Antarctic Treaty's designation of Antarctica as a natural reserve dedicated to peace and science. The protection of the Antarctic environment is to be fundamental consideration in the planning and conduct of all human activities in Antarctica. This includes protection of Antarctica's intrinsic value (including wilderness and aesthetic values) and its value as an area for the conduct of scientific research (especially research essential to understanding the global environment). The environmental principles in the Protocol also include requirements for prior assessment of the environmental impacts of all activities and regular and effective monitoring to assess predicted impacts and to detect unforeseen impacts. Through the Protocol the Parties have agreed to prohibit any mineral resource activities for a period of 50 years after the Protocol came into force. In addition to the Protocol itself, five Annexes have been drawn up: Annex I - Environmental Impact Assessment; Annex II - Conservation of Antarctic Fauna and Flora; Annex III - Waste disposal and waste management; Annex IV - Prevention of marine pollution; and Annex V: Area protection and management.
