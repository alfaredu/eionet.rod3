The Directive aims to harmonise national measures concerning the management of packaging and packaging waste in order  to provide a high level of environmental protection and to ensure the functioning of the internal market. To this end this Directive lays down measures aimed, as a first priority, to prevent the formation of packaging waste and, furthermore,  to promote the reuse, recycling and recovering of packaging waste and minimize final disposal of the waste. The Directive provides targets for recovery and recycling as well as essential requirements to the composition of packaging.
