Council Directive 78/659/EEC of 18 July 1978 on the quality of fresh waters needing protection or improvement in order to support fish life has been significantly amended on several occasions. In the interests of clarity and rationality that Directive should be codified.

In order to attain the objectives of this Directive, Member States should designate the waters to which it will apply and set limit values corresponding to certain parameters. The waters so designated should be brought into conformity with these values within five years of this designation. 
The physical and chemical parameters applicable to the salmonid and cyprinid waters designated by the Member States are listed in Annex I.
