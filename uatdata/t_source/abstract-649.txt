This regulation aims at reducing emissions of hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs) and sulphur hexafluoride (SF6) (collectively referred to as "F-Gases") in the European Union, through a series of measures targeting:
•	Better containment of F-Gases in their key stationary applications, e.g. refrigeration, air conditioning, heat pumps, fire protection, switchgear;
•	Recovery of F-Gases from products and equipment reaching their end of life;
•	Training and certification of technical personnel and companies working with F-Gases;
•	Reporting of production, import and export data within the EU;
•	Labelling of certain products and equipment containing those gases;
•	The prohibition of placing on the market some products containing F-Gases and the control of use in some specific applications where containment is not feasible and where alternatives had been readily available and cost-effective.
