The objective of the Waste Statistics Regulation (WStatR) is to ensure better monitoring of effective implementation of Community policy on waste management with regular, comparable, current and representative data on the generation, recycling, re-use and disposal of waste. The different categories of waste and the characteristics for which the statistics are to be compiled (quantity of waste handled, generation of waste by economic activities and households, waste management operations, etc.) are reviewed in detail in the tables (Annexes) attached to the Regulation. The data on which the statistics are based shall be collected by means of administrative sources, surveys (obligatory for businesses with more than 10 employees), statistical estimation procedures or combination of these means.
