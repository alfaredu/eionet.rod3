Appendix II lists migratory species that require or would benefit significantly from international co-operative Agreements under the Bonn Convention.  These may range from legally-binding treaties to less formal memoranda of understanding.  The more formal Agreements should provide for: co-ordinated species conservation and management plans; conservation and restoration of habitat; control of factors impeding migration; co-operative research and monitoring; and public education and exchange of information among Parties.  Several Agreements have been concluded to date under the auspices of the Bonn Convention.  These include: the Agreement on the Conservation of Small Cetaceans of the Baltic, North East Atlantic, Irish and North Seas (ASCOBANS); the African-Eurasian Waterbird Agreement (AEWA); the Agreement on the Conservation of Populations of European Bats (Eurobats); and the Agreement on the Conservation of Cetaceans of the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and Contiguous Atlantic Area (ACCOBAMS).
Council Decision of 24 June 1982 on the conclusion of the Convention on the conservation of migratory species of wild animals (82/461/EEC) makes the EC party to the CMS.
