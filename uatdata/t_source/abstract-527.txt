The objective of the Directive is to promote re-use, recycling and other forms of recovery of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) in order to reduce the quantity of such waste to be disposed and to improve the environmental performance of the economic operators involved in the treatment of WEEE. The WEEE Directive sets criteria for the collection, treatment and recovery of waste electrical and electronic equipment. It makes producers responsible for financing most of these activities (producer responsibility). Member States must set up a collection system under which final holders and distributors of electrical and electronic equipment can return such equipment from private households free of charge. There are targets for recycling and recovery of materials and components from the separately collected waste. Producers must provide the information required by users to enable them to identify the various components and substances as well as any hazardous substances contained in the equipment. The Member States are required on a two-yearly basis to inform the European Commission of the quantity and weight of electrical and electronic equipment placed on the market, collected and recycled.
