The aim of the EU Trade Regulation is to protect wild animals and plants currently or likely to become threatened by international trade, by regulating the trade in these species. It enforces the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) within the EU and provides additional measures for the conservation of species in trade.
