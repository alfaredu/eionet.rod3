The VOC Solvents Emissions Directive is the main policy instrument for the reduction of industrial emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in the European Union. 

It covers a wide range of solvent using activities, e.g. printing, surface cleaning, vehicle coating, dry cleaning and manufacture of footwear and pharmaceutical products. 

The VOC Solvents Emissions Directive requires installations in which such activities are applied to comply either with the emission limit values set out in the Directive or with the requirements of the so-called reduction scheme. 

New installations have to comply with the requirements of the VOC Solvents Emissions Directive at the time they are starting the activity. The final implementation date for existing installations was 31 October 2007.

At intervals of three years, Member States shall send information to the Commission on the implementation of the Directive in the form of a report.
