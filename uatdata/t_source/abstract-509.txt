The object of this Directive, drawn up pursuant to Article 2 (2) of Directive 75/442/EEC, is to approximate the laws of the Member States on the controlled management of hazardous waste.
Member States ensure that hazardous waste is recorded and identified; they also ensure that different categories of hazardous waste are not mixed and that hazardous waste is not mixed with non-hazardous waste.
Any establishment or undertaking which carries out disposal or recovery operations must obtain a permit.  The permit requirement may be waived if the method of recovery is such that there is no danger to human health or the environment, or if the Member State has adopted general measures laying down conditions for various methods of recovery.
Establishments or undertakings which carry out disposal and recovery operations and producers of hazardous waste are subject to periodic inspections.
