The aim of CITES is to ensure that international trade in specimens of wild animals and plants does not threaten their survival.  

CITES works by subjecting international trade in specimens of selected species to certain controls.  These require that all imports, exports, re-exports and introductions from the sea of species covered by the Convention have to be authorised through a licensing system.  

The species covered by CITES are listed in three Appendices, according to the degree of protection they need.  Appendix I includes species threatened with extinction.  Trade in specimens of these species is permitted only in exceptional circumstances.  Appendix II includes species not necessarily threatened with extinction, but in which trade must be controlled in order to avoid utilisation incompatible with their survival.  Finally, Appendix III contains species that are protected in at least one country, which has asked other CITES Parties for assistance in controlling the trade.
