Council Directive 76/464/EEC of 4 May 1976 on pollution caused by certain dangerous substances discharged into the aquatic environment of the Community has been significantly amended on several occasions. In order to clarify matters, a codification of the provisions in question should be drawn up.
An inventory of discharges of certain particularly dangerous substances into the aquatic environment (inland surface water, territorial waters, internal coastal waters) of the Community should be drawn up in order to know where they originated.

Annex I gives two lists of substances: 
 List I contains certain individual substances selected mainly on the basis of their toxicity, persistence and bioaccumulation, with the exception of those which are biologically harmless or which are rapidly converted into substances which are biologically harmless.
  List II contains:
— substances belonging to the families and groups of substances in List I for which the emission limit values laid down by the Directives referred to in Annex IX to Directive 2000/60/EC have not been determined by those Directives,
— certain individual substances and categories of substances belonging to the families and groups of substances listed in annex I, and which have a deleterious effect on the aquatic environment, which can, however, be confined to a given area and which depends on the characteristics and location of the water into which such substances are discharged.
