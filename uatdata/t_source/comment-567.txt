The official languages of the Alpine Convention are French, German, Italian and Slovene.  The Alpine Convention itself has been ratified by the European Union and consequently has been translated into the EU languages, including English.  However, to date, none of the Protocols have been ratified by the EU, and therefore they have not been translated into English.
