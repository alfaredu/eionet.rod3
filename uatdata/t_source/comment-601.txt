Since 1978, The Netherlands, Denmark and Germany have been working together on the protection and conservation of the Wadden Sea covering management, monitoring and research, as well as political matters. In 1982, a Joint Declaration on the Protection of the Wadden Sea was agreed upon in which the countries declare their intention to coordinate their activities and measures for the protection of the Wadden Sea. In 1997, a Trilateral Wadden Sea Plan was adopted.
