Relevant EC legislation: Council Decision 81/462/EEC of 11 June 1981 on the conclusion of the Convention on Long-range Transboundary Air Pollution. 
In 1985, the International Co-operative Programme on Assessment and monitoring of Air Pollution Effects on Forests (ICP Forests, http://www.icp-forests.org) was launched under the LRTAP Convention due to the growing public awareness of possible adverse effects of air pollution on forests. ICP Forests monitors the forest condition in Europe in co-operation with the European Union. The mandate of the ICP Forests is: 1) to monitor effects of anthropogenic factors (in particular air pollution) and natural stress factors on the condition and development of forest ecosystems in Europe; and 2) to contribute to a better understanding of cause-effect relationships in forest ecosystem functioning in various parts of Europe.  Based on its mandate, ICP Forests has the following objectives: 1) to provide a periodic overview on the spatial and temporal variation in forest condition in relation to anthropogenic (in particular air pollution) as well as natural stress factors on an European and national large-scale systematic network (Level I); 2) to contribute to a better understanding of the relationships between the condition of forest ecosystems and anthropogenic (in particular air pollution) as well as natural stress factors through intensive monitoring on a number of selected permanent observation plots spread over Europe (Level II) and to study the development of important forest ecosystems in Europe; 3) to provide a deeper insight into the interactions between the various components of forest ecosystems by compiling available information from related studies 4) to contribute in close co-operation with the ICP on Modelling and Mapping to the calculation of critical levels/loads and their excedances in forests and to improve collaboration with other environmental monitoring programmes inside and outside the CLRTAP; 5) to contribute by means of the monitoring activities to other aspects of relevance for forest policy at national, pan-European and global level, such as effects of climate changes on forests, sustainable forest management and biodiversity in forests; and 6) to provide policy-makers and the general public with relevant information.
