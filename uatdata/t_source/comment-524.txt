In 1950 the riparian states established the International Commission for the Protection of the Rhine (ICPR). It took many years to develop a regulatory framework for the protection of the river:
-in 1963 the Convention on the Protection of the River Rhine (Bern Convention, celex reference 21963A0429(01))
-in 1976 Additional Agreement to the Agreement of 29 April 1963 concerning the International Commission for the Protection of the Rhine against Pollution (celex reference 21977A0919(02) and 31977D0586),
-in 1976 the International Convention on the Prevention of Chemical Pollution of the Rhine (celex reference 21977A0919(01) and 31977D0586). In this year, the European Commission joined the ICPR.
-in 2000 the Convention on the Protection of the Rhine (celex reference 22000A1116(01) and 32000D0706) that repealed all the three above.
