The Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment of the North-East Atlantic ("OSPAR Convention") was opened for signature at the Ministerial Meeting of the Oslo and Paris Commissions in Paris on 22 September 1992. 
The Convention has been signed and ratified by all of the Contracting Parties to the Oslo or Paris Conventions (Belgium, Denmark, the Commission of the European Communities, Finland, France, Germany, Iceland, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Spain, Sweden and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland) and by Luxembourg and Switzerland. 
The OSPAR Convention entered into force on 25 March 1998. It replaces the Oslo and Paris Conventions, but Decisions, Recommendations and all other agreements adopted under those Conventions will continue to be applicable, unaltered in their legal nature, unless they are terminated by new measures adopted under the 1992 OSPAR Convention. 
As its predecessors, the OSPAR Commission has the status of an international organisation in the terms of British legislation, recognised by a Headquarters Agreement with the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
