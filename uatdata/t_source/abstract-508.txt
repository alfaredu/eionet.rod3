The aim of this Directive is to provide for measures and procedures to prevent or, where that is not practicable, to reduce as fas as possible negative effects on the environment, in particular the pollution of air, soil, surface and groundwater, and the resulting risks to human health, from the incineration of hazardous waste and, to that end, to set up and maintain appropriate operating conditions and emission limit values for hazardous waste incineration plants within the Community.
This Directive applies without prejudice to other relevant Community legislation, in particular relating to waste and the protection of the health and safety of workers at incineration plants
