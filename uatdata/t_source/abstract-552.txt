The AEWA covers 235 species of birds ecologically dependent on wetlands for at least part of their annual cycle, with a geographic area encompassing 117 countries from Europe, parts of Asia and Canada, the Middle East and Africa.  The Agreement provides for co-ordinated and concerted actions to be taken by the Range states throughout the migration systems of the waterbirds to which it applies.  Parties to the Agreement are called upon to engage in a wide range of conservation actions which are described in a comprehensive Action Plan. This detailed plan addresses such key issues as species and habitat conservation, management of human activities, research and monitoring, education and information, and implementation.  One of the fundamental activities undertaken is a regular review of the status of each migratory waterbird population within the Agreement area.
