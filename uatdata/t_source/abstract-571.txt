The International Tropical Timber Agreement (ITTA) brings together nations concerned about the trade of tropical timber and the management and conservation of tropical forests. Established under the ITTA, the International Tropical Timber Organization (ITTO) is a commodity organisation that brings together countries that produce and consume tropical timber to discuss and exchange information and develop policies on all aspects of the world tropical timber economy. The ITTO's underlying concept is to promote sustainable development of tropical forests by encouraging and assisting the tropical timber industry and trade to manage and thus conserve the resource basis upon which they depend.  The ITTA has no price regulation mechanisms or market intervention provisions, and accords equal importance to trade and conservation.  It contains provisions for information sharing, including non-tropical timber trade data, and allows for consideration of non-tropical timber issues as they relate to tropical timber.
