The Barcelona Convention obliges the Contracting Parties generally to take all appropriate measures to prevent, abate, combat and to the fullest possible extent eliminate pollution of the Mediterranean Sea Area caused by dumping from ships and aircraft or incineration at sea, discharges from ships, 
exploration and exploitation of the continental shelf and the sea bed and its subsoil, land-based sources and transboundary movements and disposal of hazardous wastes.  
The Contracting Parties shall also protect and enhance the marine environment in that Area including conservation of biological diversity so as to contribute towards its sustainable development. 
International co-operation is to be undertaken in dealing with pollution emergencies, in the monitoring of pollution, and in scientific and technical matters.

Convention for the Protection of the Mediterranean Sea against Pollution, amended as Convention for the Protection of the Marine Environment and the Coastal Region of the Mediterranean, was adopted in 1976 (CELEX reference: 21976A0216(01)). The original Barcelona Convention entered into force on 12 February 1978 and has been modified by amendments adopted in 1995.
