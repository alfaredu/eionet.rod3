The regulation seeks to ensure that European Union workers and consumers are clearly informed of the hazards associated with chemicals by means of a system of classification and labelling. The aim is to ensure that the same hazards are described and labelled in the same way in all EU countries.

The Regualtion lays down uniform requirements for the classification, labelling and packaging of chemical substances and mixtures according to the United Nationsâ€™ Globally Harmonized System (GHS). It requires companies to classify, label and package appropriately their hazardous chemicals before placing them on the market.

The main areas not covered by this regulation are: radioactive substances and mixtures, cosmetics, medicines and certain medical devices, food or the transport of dangerous goods.
