Multilateral cooperation for the protection of natural resources to prevent, control and reduce transboundary impact of surface or ground waters which mark, cross or are located on boundaries between two or more States. Transboundary impact means any significant adverse effect on the environment resulting from a change in the conditions of transboundary waters caused by a human activity, the physical origin of which is situated wholly or in part within an area under the jurisdiction of another Party.
The Convention of the Protection and Use of Transboundary Watercourses and International Lakes (Water Convention) is intended to strengthen national measures for the protection and ecologically sound management of transboundary surface waters and groundwaters.
The Convention obliges Parties to prevent, control and reduce water pollution from point and non-point sources.
The Convention also includes provisions for monitoring, research and development, consultations, warning and alarm systems, mutual assistance, institutional arrangements, and the exchange and protection of information, as well as public access to information.

On 28 November 2003, amendments to articles 25 and 26 of the Convention were introduced by decision III/1 to allow States situated outside the UNECE region to become Parties to the Convention.
