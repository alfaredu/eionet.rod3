Agenda 21 is a non-binding blueprint and action plan for a global partnership for sustainable development. Taken together, the forty chapters of Agenda 21 constitute the framework for international law in the field of sustainable development.  It comprises a Preamble and four Sections: Social and Economic Dimensions; Conservation and Management of Resources for Development; Strengthening the Role of Major Groups; and Means of Implementation.  It covers an extensive series of programme areas setting out the basis for action, objectives, activities and means of implementation, and recommended the creation of the Commission on Sustainable Development, which was created in December 1992 to ensure effective follow-up of UNCED. The CSD is a functional commission of the UN Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC).  Its role includes: 1) to review progress at the international, regional and national levels in the implementation of recommendations and commitments contained in Agenda 21; 2) to elaborate policy guidance and options for future activities to achieve sustainable development; and 3) to promote dialogue and build partnerships for sustainable development with governments, the international community and major groups identified in Agenda 21.
