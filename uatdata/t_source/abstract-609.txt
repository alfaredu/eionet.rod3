This Directive lays down provisions for:
(a) the monitoring and classification of bathing water quality;
(b) the management of bathing water quality; and
(c) the provision of information to the public on bathing water quality.
The purpose of this Directive is to preserve, protect and improve the quality of the environment and to protect human health by complementing Directive 2000/60/EC.
This Directive shall apply to any element of surface water where the competent authority expects a large number of people to bathe and has not imposed a permanent bathing prohibition, or issued permanent advice against bathing (hereinafter bathing water). It shall not apply to:
(a) swimming pools and spa pools;
(b) confined waters subject to treatment or used for therapeutic purposes;
(c) artificially created confined waters separated from surface water and groundwater.
The Directive lays down two monitoring parameters (Intestinal enterococci and Escherichia coli) instead of nineteen in the previous Directive, but sets a higher health standard according to the latest scientific knowledge. Other parameters may possibly be taken into account, such as the presence of cyanobacteria or microalgae.

The Directive has been amended by:
