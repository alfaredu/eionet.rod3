The purpose of ACCOBAMS is to reduce the threat to cetaceans in the Mediterranean and Black Sea waters and to improve knowledge of these animals.  Parties are required to implement a detailed conservation plan for cetaceans, based first on respect for legislation banning the deliberate capture of cetaceans in fishing zones by their flag vessels or those subject to their jurisdiction, on measures for minimising incidental capture and, finally, on the creation of protected areas, important for the feeding, breeding and birthing of cetaceans.  Parties also undertake to assess and manage the interactions between humans and cetaceans, conducting research and continuous monitoring, developing programmes to inform, train and educate the public, and setting up emergency response measures.
