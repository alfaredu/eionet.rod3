One goal of EPER was to meet the needs for the publicâ€™s right to know of emissions (releases) from industry to the environment as agreed in the Aarhus Convention (http://www.unece.org/env/pp/documents/cep43e.pdf). Member States shall report to the Commission every three years on emissions from all individual facilities with one or more activities as mentioned in Annex I to Directive 96/61/EC. The report must include the emissions to air and direct and indirect emissions to water for all pollutants for which the threshold values are exceeded; both pollutants and threshold values are specified in Annex A1 of Decision 2000/479/EC (26 pollutants for water, 37 for air). The emission data shall be reported for each facility according to the format of Annex A2 of Decision 2000/479/EC. In addition, Member States shall also provide the Commission with an overview report, which includes the national totals of all reported emissions for each of the source categories.
