In May 2006, the European Commission adopted a communication on "Halting Biodiversity Loss by 2010 â€“ and Beyond: Sustaining ecosystem services for human well-being" . The Communication underlined the importance of biodiversity protection as a pre-requisite for sustainable development, as well as setting out a detailed EU Biodiversity Action Plan to achieve this.

The EU Biodiversity Action Plan addresses the challenge of integrating biodiversity concerns into other policy sectors in a unified way. It specifies a comprehensive plan of priority actions and outlines the responsibility of community institutions and Member States in relation to each. It also contains indicators to monitor progress and a timetable for evaluations. The European Commission has undertaken to provide annual reporting on progress in delivery of the Biodiversity Action Plan.
