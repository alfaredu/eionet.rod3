Coastal waters, including their seabed and subsoil, are an integral part of the marine environment, and as such should also be covered by this Directive, in so far as particular aspects of the environmental status of the marine environment are not already addressed through Directive 2000/60/EC or other Community legislation. 
This Directive is consistent with the Water Framework Directive. See for its reporting obligations http://rod.eionet.europa.eu/show.jsv?id=516&mode=S
