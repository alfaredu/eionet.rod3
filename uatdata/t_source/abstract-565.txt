EUROBATS aims to address threats to 37 bat species in Europe arising from habitat degradation, disturbance of roosting sites and harmful pesticides.  Parties to the Agreement agree to work through legislation, education, conservation measures and international co-operation towards the conservation of bats in Europe.  Parties are obliged to: 1) prohibit the deliberate capture, keeping or killing of bats except under permit from its competent authority; 2) identify sites within its jurisdiction that are important to the conservation of bats and protect these sites from damage or disturbance; 3) promote public awareness; 4) promote research programmes relating to conservation and management of bats; and 5) consider the potential effects of pesticides on bats when assessing pesticides for use, and endeavour to replace timber treatment chemicals which are highly toxic to bats with safer alternatives.
