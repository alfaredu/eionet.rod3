The Regulation applies to shipments of waste, both within and into or out of the European Community. It concerns the application by the Member States of a system of prior authorization for the shipment of waste for disposal or for recovery. A common, compulsory notification system and a standard consignment note for shipments of waste have been introduced according to the Regulation. Member States have obligation take the necessary steps to inspect, sample and monitor waste shipments. The aim of renewed Regulation is to reinforce, simplify and specify the existing procedures for controlling waste shipments. It will thus reduce the risk of waste shipments not being controlled. It also seeks to incorporate into Community legislation the amendments to the lists of waste annexed to the Basel Convention as well as the revision adopted by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) in 2001.
