This Directive establishes limit values for concentrations of benzene and carbon monoxide in ambient air, and requires to assess concentrations of those pollutants in ambient air on the basis of common methods and criteria, as well as to obtain adequate information on concentrations of benzene and carbon monoxide and ensure that it is made available to the public.
 
The limit value for benzene must be met by 2010 unless an extension is granted.
 
Member States have to prepare attainment programmes showing how the limit values will be met on time for those zones or agglomerations where attainments by "business as usual" cannot be presumed. These programmes must be made directly available to the public, and must also be sent to the Commission see Comm. Dec. 2004/224/EC.
