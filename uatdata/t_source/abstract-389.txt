The International Maritime Organization is the United Nations' specialized agency responsible for improving maritime safety and preventing pollution from ships. Around 40 conventions and protocols have been adopted by the Organization and most of them have been amended on several occasions to ensure that they are kept up to date with changes taking place in world shipping.
