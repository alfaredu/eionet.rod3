Council Directive 79/923/EEC of 30 October 1979 on the quality required of shellfish waters has been substantially amended. In the interests of clarity and rationality the said Directive should be codified.

In order to attain the objectives of this Directive, the Member States must designate the waters to which it will apply and set limit values corresponding to certain parameters. The waters so designated will have to conform to these values within six years of designation.
The parameters applicable to the waters designated by the Member States are listed in Annex I.
