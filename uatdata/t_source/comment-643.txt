Directive 2008/98/EC  from 12/12/10  repeals the Directives 75/439/EEC, 91/689/EEC and 2006/12/EC.
In the interests of clarity and readability, Directive 2006/12/EC should be repealed and replaced by the new directive. In order to clarify the operation of the mixing ban laid down in Directive 91/689/EEC, and to protect the environment and human health, the exemptions to the mixing ban should additionally comply with best available techniques as defined in Directive 96/61/EC. Directive 91/689/EEC should therefore be repealed. In the interests of the simplification of Community legislation and the reflection of environmental benefits, the relevant provisions of Council Directive 75/439/EEC of 16 June 1975 on the disposal of waste oils should be integrated into this Directive. Directive 75/439/EEC should therefore be repealed. References to the repealed Directives shall be construed as references to this Directive and shall be read in accordance with the correlation table set out in Annex V.
