The UNCCD aims to promote effective action through innovative local programmes and supportive international partnerships. The Convention acknowledges that the struggle to protect drylands will be a long one because the causes of desertification are many and complex, ranging from international trade patterns to unsustainable land management practices. Countries affected by desertification implement the Convention by developing and carrying out national, sub-regional, and regional action programmes. Criteria for preparing these programmes are detailed in the UNCCD's five regional implementation annexes: Africa (considered a priority because that is where desertification is most severe), Asia, Latin America and the Caribbean, the Northern Mediterranean, and Central and Eastern Europe. Drawing on past lessons, the Convention states that these programmes must adopt a democratic, bottom-up approach. They should emphasize popular participation and the creation of an "enabling environment" designed to allow local people to help themselves to reverse land degradation.
