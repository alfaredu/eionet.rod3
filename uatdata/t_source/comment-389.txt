There are reporting obligations here but they are not environmental obligations, mostly technical and not requiring monitoring or assessment data on state of the environment or pressures on the environment, so they have not been included here. They may need to be considered later if information is needed for Reponses to environmental problems in the DPSIR scheme. They are not legal except for those  incorporated into international laws
