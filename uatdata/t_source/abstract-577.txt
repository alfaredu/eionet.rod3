The aim of the CCAMLR is to conserve the marine life of the Southern Ocean, although this does not prevent harvesting carried out in a rational manner.  (Whales and seals are specifically excluded from management under the Convention because they are the subjects of other conventions, namely the International Convention for the Regulation of Whaling and the Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals.)  Conservation measures adopted by CCAMLR are based on scientific advice, and include the designation of protected species, allowable catch, open and closed seasons, open and closed areas, special areas for protection and scientific study, and the regulation of harvesting effort.  A precautionary approach has been implemented to minimise risk associated with unsustainable practices in conditions of uncertainty. This is complemented by the need to take into account ecological links between species and nature.  The Convention defines a Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources and a Scientific Committee to work together to manage marine living resources in the Southern Ocean.
