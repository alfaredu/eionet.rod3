The CLRTAP establishes a broad framework for co-operative action on air pollution. The Parties undertake, by means of exchanges of information, consultation, research and monitoring, to develop policies and strategies to combat the discharge of air pollutants. Parties should also adopt air quality management systems and control measures, compatible with balanced development and using the best available technology which is economically feasible. In addition, Parties agree to participate in co-ordinating measures under the Co-operative programme for the long-range transmission of air pollutants in Europe (EMEP). Activities under the Convention initially focused on reducing the effects of acid rain through the control of sulphur emissions.  Later, the scope was widened to address the formation of ground level ozone (smog) and, more recently, persistent organic pollutants (POPs). The Convention has been added to by eight protocols: 1) Protocol to Abate Acidification, Eutrophication and Ground-level Ozone; 2) Protocol on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs); 3) Protocol on Heavy Metals; 4) Protocol on Further Reduction of Sulphur Emissions; 5) Protocol concerning the Control of Emissions of Volatile Organic Compounds or their Transboundary Fluxes; 6) Protocol concerning the Control of Nitrogen Oxides or their Transboundary Fluxes; 7) Protocol on the Reduction of Sulphu Emissions or their Transboundary Fluxes by at least 30 per cent; and 8) Protocol on Long-term Financing of the Co-operative Programme for Monitoring and Evaluation of the Long-range Transmission of Air Pollutants in Europe (EMEP).
