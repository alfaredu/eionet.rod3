The main aim of this Directive is to provide a common basis for tackling the noise problem across the EU. The objectives include monitoring the environmental problem; by requiring Member States to draw up 'strategic noise maps' for major roads, railways, airports and agglomerations, using harmonised noise indicators. Local noise issues are addressed by requiring competent authorities to draw up action plans to reduce noise where necessary and maintain environmental noise quality where it is good. Member States shall report on noise maps. 
The Member States shall report on limit values in force and shall ensure that the information from strategic noise maps and summaries of the action plans are sent to the Commission.
