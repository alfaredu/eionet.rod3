The main goal of the Helsinki Convention is to protect the marine environment of the Baltic Sea from all sources of pollution, and to restore and safeguard its ecological balance. In order to restore and preserve the ecosystem of the Baltic Sea area, Contracting Parties are required to individually or jointly take all appropriate legislative, administrative or other measures to prevent and eliminate pollution. The Convention covers the whole of the Baltic Sea area, including inland waters as well as the water of the sea itself and the sea-bed. Measures are also taken in the whole catchment area of the Baltic Sea to reduce land-based pollution. Emissions from both point sources and diffuse sources into water and air should be monitored. The Convention makes use of the precautionary and 'polluter pays' principles, and requires Contracting Parties to adopt best environmental practices and best available technologies to prevent the pollution of the Baltic Sea.
