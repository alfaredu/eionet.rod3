The aim of this Directive is to ensure that where animals are used for experimental or other scientific purposes, the provisions for the animal's protection laid down by law or regulation or administrative provisions in the Member States, are approximated. 
At regular intervals Member States shall inform the Commission of the measures taken in this area and provide a suitable summary of the statistical information on the use of animals in experiments.
