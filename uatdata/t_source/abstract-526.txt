The objective of the ELV Directive is to prevent waste from end-of-life vehicles and promote the collection, re-use and recycling of their components to protect the environment. The Directive sets clear quantified targets for reuse, recycling and recovery of vehicles and their components and pushes producers to manufacture new vehicles also with a view to their recyclability. The rate of re-use and recovery must be increased to 85% by average weight per vehicle and by year 2006 and to 95% by 2015. Use of lead, mercury, cadmium and hexavalent chromium will be prohibited in materials and components in vehicles put on the market after 1 July 2003. Member States must set up collection systems for end-of-life vehicles and ensure that all vehicles are transferred to authorised treatment facilities. The last holder of an end-of-life vehicle will be able to dispose it free of charge ("free take-back" principle).
