The purpose of this Directive is to achieve integrated prevention and control of pollution arising from the activities listed in its Annex I. It lays down measures designed to prevent or, where that is not practicable, to reduce emissions in the air, water and land from the largest industrial installations, including measures concerning waste, in order to achieve a high level of protection of the environment taken as a whole. In order to be operated, all installations covered by the Directive are required to obtain a permit from the competent authorities in the EU Member States  Those permits must contain conditions based on the Best Available Techniques (BAT), as defined in Article 2 of the Directive.
Article 17(1) states an obligation on the MS to send available representative data concerning emission limit values to the Commission every three years. Article 17(2) states an obligation on the Commission to organise a continuous exchange of information between Member States and industry concerning BAT and associated monitoring and article 17(3) is related to the hereunder mentioned RO.
The Directive was originally adopted as Council Directive 96/61/EC and after several amendments codified as Directive 2008/1/EC.
