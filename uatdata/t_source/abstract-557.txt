The World Heritage Convention recognises that parts of the cultural and/or natural heritage are of outstanding interest and should be preserved as part of the world heritage of mankind as a whole.  Its primary mission is to define and conserve this heritage, by drawing up a list of sites of outstanding value and to ensure their protection through a closer co-operation among nations.  By signing the Convention, each country pledges to conserve the sites situated on its territory, some of which may be recognised as World Heritage.  Their preservation for future generations then becomes a responsibility shared by the international community as a whole.
