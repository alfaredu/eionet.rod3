This Directive establishes specific measures as provided for in Article 17(1) and (2) of Directive 2000/60/EC in order to prevent and control groundwater pollution. These measures include in particular:
(a) criteria for the assessment of good groundwater chemical status; and
(b) criteria for the identification and reversal of significant and sustained upward trends and for the definition of starting points for trend reversals.
This Directive also complements the provisions preventing or limiting inputs of pollutants into groundwater already contained in Directive 2000/60/EC, and aims to prevent the deterioration of the status of all bodies of groundwater.
