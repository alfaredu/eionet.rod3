The Decision establishes the Community statistical programme for the period 2008-2012.

Annex I specifies the approaches, the main fields and the objectives of the actions envisaged during the duration of the programme. Annex II provides a summary of statistical requirements viewed from the perspective of the policy needs of the European Union.

Meeting the data demands of the ‘Thematic Strategies’, e.g. on the ‘Prevention and recycling of waste’, the ‘Sustainable use of natural resources’ and the ‘Sustainable use of pesticides’ is the key priority; the production of basic environmental statistics is continued, as well as the provision of statistics and indicators on water, air, biodiversity, soil, forests and land use to the other EDCs.
