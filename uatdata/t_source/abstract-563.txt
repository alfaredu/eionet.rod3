The aim of the Birds Directive is to provide for the protection, management and control of naturally occurring wild birds and their nests, eggs and habitats within the European Union. It serves to ensure that all wild birds receive basic protection from trapping and killing; that sufficient habitat is protected to assure the survival of threatened and migratory species; that large-scale or non-selective means of taking birds are prohibited; and that the exploitation, sale or commercialisation of most species is prevented. Certain exceptions are made for legitimate sporting and hunting practices, and to allow governments to take action when birds pose serious risks for human health and safety, crops, livestock, fisheries, forests, water, or other flora and fauna. In particular it seeks to protect all wild birds and the habitats of listed species through the designation of specially protected areas (SPAs), which are incorporated in the Natura 2000 network established by the Habitats Directive 92/43/EEC.
