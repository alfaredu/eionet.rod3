The Bern Convention aims to conserve wild flora and fauna and their habitats and to promote European co-operation in that field.  To this end, it co-ordinates the action of European States in adopting common standards and policies for the sustainable use of biological diversity, thus contributing to the improvement of the quality of life of Europeans and the promotion of sustainable development.  Special attention is given to endangered and vulnerable species, including endangered and vulnerable migratory species.  Species requiring special attention are listed in three Appendices as follows: Appendix I - strictly protected flora species; Appendix II - strictly protected fauna species; and Appendix III - protected fauna species.  Appendix IV identifies prohibited means and methods of killing, capture and other forms of exploitation.
