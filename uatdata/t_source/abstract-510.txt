The aim of this Directive is to prevent or to limit as far as practicable negative effects on the environment, in particular pollution by emissions into air, soil, surface water and groundwater, and the resulting risks to human health, from the incineration and co-incineration of waste. 
This aim shall be met by means of stringent operational conditions and technical requirements and emission limit values for waste incineration and co-incineration plants.
