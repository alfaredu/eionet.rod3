34 countries have ratified the Water Convention (see status of ratification on Convention website for a list). It enters into force in a new member 90 days after signature. Under the Convention no reporting is required but Parties at their meetings share information on their implementation of the Convention and of soft law instruments (recommendations, guidelines) adopted under the framework of the Convention. On 28 November 2003, amendments to articles 25 and 26 were introduced to allow States situated outside the UNECE region to become Parties to the Convention. The Convention encourages the signature of multilateral cooperation agreements under its umbrella.
