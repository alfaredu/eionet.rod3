The purpose of this Regulation is the establishment of a new Community scheme on monitoring of forests and environmental interactions to protect the Community's forests.  The scheme is built on the achievements of two Council regulations for monitoring the impacts of atmospheric pollution (Council Regulation (EEC) No. 3528/86 of 17 November 1986 on the protection of Community forests against air pollution) and of forest fires (Council Regulation (EEC) No. 2158/92 of 23 July 1992 on the protection of Community forests against fire).  Regulation 2152/2003 provides a multi-annual framework, initially covering a six-year period from 2003 to 2008.  It adapts the scope of the earlier regulations to provide a flexible monitoring scheme to assess forest ecosystem conditions in a broader context.  It also simplifies existing activities by regrouping elements of both of the earlier regulations under a single framework regulation covering the protection and monitoring of forests.
Starting from 2007, the Regulation (EC) No 2152/2003 will be repealed and replaced by the 'Financial Instrument for the Environment (LIFE+)'.
