The Cartagena Convention requires Parties to adopt measures aimed at preventing, reducing and controlling pollution of the following areas: pollution from ships; pollution caused by dumping; pollution from sea-bed activities; airborne pollution; and pollution from land-based sources and activities. In addition, the Parties are required to take appropriate measures to protect and preserve rare or fragile ecosystems, as well as the habitat of depleted, threatened or endangered species and to develop technical and other guidelines for the planning and environmental impact assessments of important development projects in order to prevent or reduce harmful impacts on the area of application.  The Convention has been supplemented by three Protocols: 1) Protocol Concerning Co-operation in Combating Oil Spills in the Wider Caribbean Region; 2) Protocol Concerning Specially Protected Areas and Wildlife in the Wider Caribbean Region (SPAW Protocol); and 3) Protocol on Marine Pollution from Land-based Sources and Activities (LBS Protocol).
