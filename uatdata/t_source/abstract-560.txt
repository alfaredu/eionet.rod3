The Directive requires Member States to designate sites based on species and habitats in the Directive's annexes. It thereby establishes the Natura 2000 network of protected sites, which also includes the sites designated according to the Birds Directive. Furthermore, the Directive also deals with the protection of species (animals and plants) over the whole territory of a Member State.
