The Directive 2006/21/EC applies to waste resulting from extraction, processing and storage of mineral resources and the working of quarries. It provides for measures, procedures and guidance to prevent or reduce as far as possible any adverse effects on the environment, in particular water, air, soil, fauna and flora and landscape, and any resultant risks to human health, brought about as a result of the management of waste from the extractive industries.
According to the Directive no waste management installation of the extractive industries can operate without a permit issued by the competent authorities. Member States must ensure that operators of the mining waste facility draw up a waste management plan with objective to prevent or reduce the generation of waste and its negative impact and to  
encourage waste recovery through recycling, re-use or recovery. 
Waste facilities may be of two types according to their potential risks: a waste facility whose failure or incorrect operation would present a significant accident hazard (category A) and all other waste facilities(category B). For facilities in category A, the competent authority must compile an external emergency plan for the measures to be taken off-site in the event of an accident.
The operator must provide a financial guarantee before the beginning of waste processing operations so as to ensure that the provisions of the Directive are complied with and that the financial resources for restoring the site are always available.
A mining waste facility is regarded as finally closed when the competent authority carries out a final inspection, studies the reports submitted by the operator, confirms that the site has been restored and gives its approval. After closure, the operator must maintain and monitor the site for as long as the competent authority considers necessary.
