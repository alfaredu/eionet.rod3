Member States shall ensure that up-to-date information on ambient concentrations of SO2, NOx, particulate matter and lead is routinely made available to the public. 

The health limit values for NO2 and Pb must be met by 2010. 
Member States have to prepare attainment programmes showing how the limit values will be met on time for those zones or agglomerations where attainments by "business as usual" cannot be presumed. These programmes must be made directly available to the public, and must also be sent to the Commission see Comm. Dec. 2004/224/EC.
