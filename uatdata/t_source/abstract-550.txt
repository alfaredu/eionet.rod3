The Protocol aims at ensuring an adequate level of protection in the field of the safe transfer, handling and use of living modified organisms (LMOs) resulting from modern biotechnology.  It establishes a harmonised set of international rules and procedures designed to ensure that countries are provided with the relevant information to enable them to make informed decisions before agreeing to the import of LMOs.  It also ensures that LMO shipments are accompanied by appropriate identification documentation.
