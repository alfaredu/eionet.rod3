This database contains information describing reporting obligations that countries have towards international organisations for air, waste, water, biodiversity and EEA priority data flows. These themes have been quality assessed.

The database has 3 functions:

*to assist in the analysis of member countries reporting obligation's burden;
* to support member countries in planning and fulfilling reporting obligations;
* to assist in streamlining the flow of data to the EEA and other international organisations.

---------------------------------------------------

The database covers EEA member countries as well as countries included in the following groupings:
* Central and eastern European Countries (CEEC)
* Eastern Europe, Caucasus and Central Asia (EECCA)
* Countries participating in the Desertification Information System for the Mediterranean (DISMED)

The ROD database contains records at 3 levels. The top level is the legislative instrument (LI) level. Underneath this level is a summary reporting obligation (RO) level and then the reporting activity (RA) level. A legal instrument record is the legal basis for one or more reporting obligations.

The Reporting obligation record is a summary display presenting information from both the RA, RO and LI levels in the database.

Reporting obligation is taken to mean:
Any requirement to provide specified information to (or to "inform") the secretariat, coordinating body or governing body of the instrument, or their representatives, whether or not there is a prescribed format or fixed frequency, or whether or not the word "report" is used. 

ROD focuses on environmental reporting for EEA member countries to international organisations. Coverage extends to pan European reporting.

Excluded from ROD are non-environmental reporting, requirements for proposals or the seeking of permits, requirements for specific actions to be taken (as opposed to reporting on actions taken), and administrative processes such as notifications of contact points, instances of issuance/withdrawal of permits (rather than reports that summarise permits issued), notifications of legal transposition and implementation measures.

Reporting activity level corresponds crudely to data or information deliveries that arise from a reporting obligation. It is in this view that the details of reporting obligation requirements are shown. In particular, the focus is on dates (when deliveries are due) and the thematic issues covered. It is proposed to merge the RO and RA level in the near future.
