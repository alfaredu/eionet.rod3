If the current legal instrument amends some existing act, or if it is subsidiary legislation dependent on the framework provided by another legal instrument (Ex a convention) then this relationship should be specified by selecting a "Parent legal instrument" from the list.

The parent legal instrument needs to be entered first. If the parent legal instrument is not yet entered into the ROD, complete the current LI record first. Then create a new legislative instrument for the parent legislation. When this record is completed, return to the child legal instrument in edit mode and select the parent instrument from the list.
