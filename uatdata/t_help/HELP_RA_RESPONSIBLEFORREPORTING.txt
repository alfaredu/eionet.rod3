This field should be filled with the details of the technical contact for the reporting for this obligation. This is the person who will prepare and upload the reported information. The contact details can be entered into ROD in different ways.

Ideally, it should be a CIRCA role making use of country suffixes. The CIRCA role prefix (without the country-specific part) should be entered (for example eionet-nrc-acc). Generally, the "national contacts" role should be the NRC for Eionet dataflows and the "national coordinator" should be the PCP Eionet role.

On saving a record in ROD, the role is checked against the CIRCA directory. Non-existent roles will result in an error message. A list of all roles in the directory can be found at: http://eea.eionet.eu.int:8980/Members/irc/eionet-circle/Home/central_dir_admin?fn=roles&rd=0&af=0&ud=0&od=0&act=srch&v=*

Alternatively a central CIRCA role may be the contact point for the list of coordinators for all countries. The third option is that the name of the list with a URL pointing to where the list of contacts for this reporting obligation is available on the Internet can be used. These options and the 3 fields should cater for most situations.
