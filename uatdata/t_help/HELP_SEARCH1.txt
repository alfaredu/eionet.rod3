The query form will generate a list of reporting obligations. The list can be refined by selecting any combination from the three drop down lists.

For example, select a country from the countries drop-down menu if you are only interested getting results relevant for a  particular country.

Select the issue that you are interested in to generate a list of all reporting obligations for that issue.

Select an organisation to see all the reporting obligations for that organisation.

Click on the GO button to generate the list.

Naturally if an item from all three list boxes is selected, then the list will only list reporting obligaitons that are for that specific organisation, country and issue together.
