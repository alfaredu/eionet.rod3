Generally one or two environmental issues should be selected for a reporting obligation. 

The left-hand select box displays the items that can be selected. Environmental issues can be managed by moving items to the right hand box. Select item(s) from the left-hand box and then click the "-->" button. Similarly, to remove items, select item(s) from the right-hand box and press the "<--" button. To select multiple items from a select box, a CTRL key has to be held down while the items are clicked with the mouse.

The environmental issues are aligned with the themes used in the EEA Reference Centre and Data warehouse. They are not aligned with the Eur-lex classification used for legislative instruments.
