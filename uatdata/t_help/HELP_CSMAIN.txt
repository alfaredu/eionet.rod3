This page shows deadlines that countries have for reporting obligations. This functionality in ROD works best when the deadlines are entered as numeric dates.

Explanation of columns:

* Reporting obligation
Reporting obligation is taken to mean:
Any requirement to provide specified information to (or to "inform") the secretariat, coordinating body or governing body of the instrument, or their representatives, whether or not there is a prescribed format or fixed frequency, or whether or not the word "report" is used. ROD focuses on environmental reporting for EEA member countries to international organisations. 

* Reporting to
This is the organisation to which the reported data is sent. This may be the same as the issuer of the legislation or can be different.

* Deadline and Next Deadline
The next reporting due date. The next deadline field is the following deadline (Only for numeric dates).
