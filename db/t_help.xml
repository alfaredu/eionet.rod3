One of the three options should be selected (Compulsory, expected or voluntary) depending on the legal framework and requirements.&#10;&#10;Compulsory&#10;Required reporting obligations must be submitted in order to be in compliance with the legal instrument. Typically the obligation will arise from the articles of the instrument with wording such as &quot;shall&quot;, &quot;requires&quot;, &quot;will&quot; or &quot;must&quot;.The format and content of required reports may not carry the same level of obligation, since the report format may be specified in administrative decisions rather than ratified articles of the instrument. Hence the submission of a required report in an incomplete or incorrect format may not constitute lack of compliance. In applying this definition it is the level of compulsion of the reporting obligation itself that is paramount.&#10;&#10;Expected &#10;A report that all parties under normal circumstances are expected to submit but with incomplete compulsion, i.e. failure to submit would not seem to constitute a lack of compliance with the instrument. The obligation may arise from articles of the instrument, but typically from subsequent decisions of the governing body (e.g. Conference of the Parties or EEA Management Board) and often will carry wording such as &quot;should&quot;, &quot;recommend&quot; or &quot;will endeavour&quot;. The use of &quot;Expected&quot; type of reporting may also be appropriate for use where the Instrument itself is a non-compulsory agreement for example, &quot;Agenda 21&quot; (obligation to report to the Commission on Sustainable Development), or the UNESCO Man and Biosphere programme.&#10;&#10;Voluntary&#10;A report that parties may submit at their own volition. These usually arise from governance or administrative decisions and are specifically identified as &quot;voluntary&quot; or employ phrases such as &quot;may&quot; or &quot;might&quot; or &quot;parties are invited (or encouraged) to?&quot;. It is clear and obvious that failure to report does not contravene the terms of the Instrument."/>

If needed additional comments can be added in the &quot;dates comments&quot; field. Use of text dates should be avoided, however, it is accepted that in some instances no alternative is suitable. &#10;&#10;EITHER numeric OR text based dates can be entered but not both.&#10;&#10;The following additional guidance on dates is provided:&#10;&#10;Reporting that is due in a year with no month or date specified is set as being due at on 31 December of the year. If the month is specified, then the reporting is set as being due on the last day in the month. The &quot;dates comments&quot; field should indicate this with &quot;year only specified&quot; or &quot;Year and month only specified&quot; as appropriate.&#10;&#10;If reporting is due in time for a regular event, such as a 3 yearly conference of the parties to a convention, then a numeric date for the COP should be entered in the baseline date field, along with a frequency. In this example the frequency would be 36. A note in the date comments field should indicate something similar to  &quot;Reporting submitted prior to 3 yearly COP depending on exact dates of COP&quot;.&#10;&#10;For numeric datesEnter a value for &quot;Baseline reporting date&quot; and then the &quot;Reporting frequency in months&quot; (whole number) fields. From these, &quot;Next due date&quot; is calculated. Some calendar rounding is automatically done in this calculation for leap years and so on.&#10;&#10;If reporting frequency in months is set to zero, the application assumes non-repeating reporting date (one-off) and uses &quot;First reporting&quot; date as the &quot;Next due date&quot;. The &quot;Next due date&quot; will never be larger than &quot;Valid to&quot; date (no need to report if the obligation is no longer valid). The application recalculates the &quot;Next due date&quot; fields for all obligations every day, so they are always up to date.

The top level is the legislative instrument (LI) level. Underneath this level is a summary reporting obligation (RO) level and then the reporting activity (RA) level. A legal instrument record is the legal basis for one or more reporting obligations.&#10;&#10;The Reporting obligation record is a summary display presenting information from both the RA, RO and LI levels in the database.&#10;&#10;Reporting obligation is taken to mean:&#10;Any requirement to provide specified information to (or to &quot;inform&quot;) the secretariat, coordinating body or governing body of the instrument, or their representatives, whether or not there is a prescribed format or fixed frequency, or whether or not the word &quot;report&quot; is used. &#10;&#10;ROD focuses on environmental reporting for EEA member countries to international organisations. Coverage extends to pan European reporting.&#10;&#10;Excluded from ROD are non-environmental reporting, requirements for proposals or the seeking of permits, requirements for specific actions to be taken (as opposed to reporting on actions taken), and administrative processes such as notifications of contact points, instances of issuance/withdrawal of permits (rather than reports that summarise permits issued), notifications of legal transposition and implementation measures.&#10;&#10;Reporting activity level corresponds crudely to data or information deliveries that arise from a reporting obligation. It is in this view that the details of reporting obligation requirements are shown. In particular, the focus is on dates (when deliveries are due) and the thematic issues covered.
